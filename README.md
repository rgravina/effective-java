# Working through Effective Java 

I created these examples while reading Effective Java (Second Edition) by Joshua Bloch for my own learning.

## Setup

If you'd like to run the tests and look at the code, they should import and run in IntelliJ (Community Edition).

With a bit of work a Makefile could be made which includes jUnit in the classpath etc. and runs the tests.

## Catalog

- Item 01: A simple service registry and provider example.
- Item 02: Makes a Color class using a builder.
- Item 03: Class and enum variants of the Singleton pattern.
- Item 04: A Utils class which can not be instantiated.
